standing on the mountain high,looking at the moon through clear
blue sky.i should see some friends, but they don't comprehends.
so many people, all around the world, tell where to find someone
like you girl.take me to your heart,take me to your soul.show me 
what love is, haven't got a clue. show me that wonders can be true.
they say nothing last forever,we will be here today.love is now or
never,bring me far away.
